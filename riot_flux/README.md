## Riot Flux demo by using [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl)

Online demo: http://txchen.github.io/feplay/riot_flux/

RiotControl cannot be simpler, it just has 15 lines of code! And it can act as a dispatcher with RiotJs, in flux architecture. Just wonderful!

I followed RiotControl's demo to create this sample app, it is another implementation of [this](https://github.com/voronianski/flux-comparison) project.

As you can see, the code is much simpler and easier to understand, than any of ReactJS implementations. Besides, the total js size is much smaller than React.

Why not give [RiotJs](https://muut.com/riotjs/) 5 minutes?
